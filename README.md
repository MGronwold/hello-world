# hello-world
A simple exercise that's getting me started while learning something new.

I'm here because of the work my computer is doing on the Science United (SU) Volunteer Computing (VC) project. The "About Science United" page described SU's Goals, Project, Software, Status and Help Wanted. Under the Help Wanted section it was mentioned that people with "the needed technical skills (PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS...)" can help develop and debug Science United. "Go to Github and scan the issues." In order to "scan the issues" I figured I should figure out how GitHub works, hence the creation of this "hello-world" repository to help myself to get started with GitHub!
